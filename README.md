# Superstore-Sales-Trend-Analysis-using-Pandas-Matplotlib
Analyzed monthly sales and profit trends using the Superstore dataset. Cleaned the data, extracted time-based features, and used bar graphs to compare monthly performance. Found key insights like months with high sales but low profit.


# 🛒 Superstore Sales Trend Analysis

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Superstore dataset to uncover monthly sales and profit trends. Built using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

---

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze how sales and profit change over time and identify trends or inconsistencies. This kind of analysis can help businesses make better decisions around promotions, inventory, and strategy.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset: Superstore Sales Data (`superstore.csv`)
- Features used:
  - `Order Date`
  - `Sales`
  - `Profit`

---

## 🧠 What I Did

- Loaded and explored the dataset in Pandas
- Converted order dates into `Month-Year` format
- Grouped and aggregated data monthly
- Created a **bar chart** comparing monthly **Sales vs Profit**
- Answered key business questions based on data

---

## ❓ Key Questions Answered

- Which month generated the most sales?
- Which month had the lowest profit?
- Are there months with high sales but low profit?

---

## 📌 Insights

- Some months had high sales but **very low profit** — indicating poor margin or high discounting.
- Identified **peak-performing months** in terms of both sales and profit.
- Pinpointed **low-profit months**, which can inform business strategy.
